## Definition of Big Data
From what I’ve learned this week as well as what I’ve known, Big Data refers tolarge data sets that can be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns and trends, many of which are not easily understandable without using computational methods. This is because Big Data is usually very large and often cannot be processed by regular data management tools, requiring software and hardware made specifically for large amounts of data. Lastly, Big Data can be characterized by the 5 Vs, which we learned this week include: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value.
